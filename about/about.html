																			<h3><a href="#">Ron Farrer</a></h3>
																			<h4>Sys Admin / Jr. DBA / Developer</h4>
																			<p>
																				Ron has more than 20 years of experience with Linux and is a former Debian Developer. He has also worked in
																				the hosting industry for over 10 years with technologies such as Xen, OpenVZ, and Linux KVM. Some of his
																				professional interests include virtual machines, networking, security, cryptography, programming, distributed
																				and parallel computing, and finding new ways to automate mundane tasks. In his spare time, Ron likes to fly
																				drones, toy with cryptocurrencies, find new uses for Raspberry Pi boards, play video and board games, make
																				things with 3D printers, go boating and camping in the Pacific Northwest, hangout with his cat Eva, and of
																				course spend time with his family.
																				One fun fact is that Ron’s cat, Eva, was named after a character from the movie WALL-E because as a kitten
																				she was all-white and very rambunctious.

																			<h3><a href="#">Ivan Lezhnjov IV</a></h3>
																			<h3>Sys Admin / Jr. DBA</h3>
																			<p>
																				Ivan has devoted all of his spare energy to teaching himself the ways of GNU, Free Software, Open Source,
																				Linux and the sorcery of what is called, quite fashionably in IT today, the art of systems engineering. Much to
																				his content he's living his dream, and is grateful and proud to be part of a company that shares a similar creed.
																				In whatever little free time he has, he enjoys riding his Austrian KTM hard tail mountain bike all around and
																				across the ancient city of Lviv. He cannot imagine his life without music, and you can often hear rhythmic sounds
																				of American blues, jazz, instrumental piano or some cosmic chill-out tunes, but also rebellious war cries of
																				counterculture hardcore punk and, you might say oddly, sweet, sweet J-pop songs in his apartment.
																				A fun fact about Ivan is that he hates telling fun facts about himself, but if you insisted, he would say that he's
																				Ivan IV and this lineage of men in his family tree sharing exactly the same full name for four generations straight
																				is believed to be quite unintentional.

																			<h3><a href="#">Amanda Nystrom</a></h3>
																			<h3>Project Manager</h3>
																			<p>
																				Amanda is the project manager for CMD and is often the one pulling her hair out and saying “Seriously?” at her
																				computer screen. She enjoys her job of project managing tasks for numerous customers who have a variety of PostgreSQL
																				and database needs. Her focus at CMD is to make sure all of our clients are happy and well taken care of, as well as
																				providing interesting entertainment to the team by way of sarcasm and “stupid” questions. In her life outside of work,
																				she has many hobbies and aspiring dreams. But that’s too gooshy.
																				A fun fact about Amanda is that she has a love/hate relationship with the sun.

																			<h3><a href="#">Angela Roberson</a></h3>
																			<h3>Account Manager</h3>
																			<p>
																				As Command Prompt's Account Manager, Angela helps ensure our business  relationships are healthy and long-lasting. From
																				sales, contract  negotiations, and internal human resources to account management and  bookkeeping, Angela is key in keeping
																				the business practices at Command  Prompt thriving. In her spare time, Angela is raising two children with her husband in
																				South Louisiana where she loves to cook with a lot of butter, knit, read, and travel as much as possible.
																				A fun fact about Angela is that Joshua Drake (JD) is Angela’s big brother.

																			<h3><a href="#">Andrew Smith</a></h3>
																			<h3>Senior Developer / DBA</h3>
																			<p>
																				Andrew has been fascinated by robotics and artificial intelligence all his life and spent most of his spare time researching
																				and experimenting, especially in the field of natural language understanding. He has over 30 years experience with database
																				systems and *nix, half of that being PostgreSQL on Linux. He recently started keeping fish and must like dogs because he still
																				has one. Married with two amazing grown up kids.
																				Something fascinating about Andrew is that he works from a purpose-built facility that is proofed against both wireless
																				surveillance and axe murderer neighbors.

																			<h3><a href="#">Michael Vitale</a></h3>
																			<h3>DBA</h3>
																			<p>
																				Michael has over 20 years of experience working with relational databases as both a DBA and Database Developer. He wrote the
																				DBMan program (<a href="http://sqlexec.com/DBMan.htm">http://sqlexec.com/DBMan.htm</a>), that is still being used today. Outside
																				of work, he loves to read and meditate on the Bible. His other "passion" is to have a luscious green grass yard with no weeds.
																				Unfortunately, he is not making too much progress in this area.
																				Michael also happens to be a meme lover.

																			<h3><a href="#">Eric Worden</a></h3>
																			<h3>Senior Developer / DBA</h3>
																			<p>
																				Eric has a long career designing beautiful databases (and administering not-so-beautiful ones) and writing monster SQL.  He is
																				a long time open source enthusiast and sometimes-contributor (see projects sphinxkeys and pgchronos at github).  He's an
																				accomplished Python web developer also. However, his most prized achievement is getting his sound card to work under Debian Slink.
																				In his time away from Postgres, he bakes bread, kicks deer out of his yard, and ventures into the mountains of the PNW.
																				Something awesome about Eric is that he's also the crown prince of the little known Baltic kingdom of Dvorak.

																			<h3><a href="#">You</a></h3>
																			<h3>To Be Determined</h3>
																			<p>
																				Work from home for the only company still operating from the beginning of it all! No Venture Captial, No Debt, No missed paychecks,
																				No B.S. Just honest, consulting and support for the PostgreSQL Centered Stack! We seek someone who has a deep knowledge of at least
																				one UNIX-like system (preferably Linux), and who knows how to manage heterogeneous systems. You can demonstrate strong skills in
																				systems administration. You have a clear understanding of how to administer several systems that are mostly the same, but that have
																				small local differences. If you do not feel comfortable saying, "I'm not familiar with that in your environment," then reading
																				documentation, and coming back with a test plan for deployment that will reveal problems with your strategy, this is not a job for
																				you.
